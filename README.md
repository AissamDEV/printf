# PRINTF TEAM PROJECT

## Brief :

### On this project we create a simple function that's prints most format of text

## Team :

• Mohamed Dani
• Aissam AbouQassim El edrissi

## How to use ?

• Firstly you have to add the file to your project files

• Secondly you have to Creat and add the following prototype to the header file you can name it with main.h :

``` int _printf(const char *format, ...);  ```

• Secondly you have to include the main.h on your main project :

``` #include "main.h" ```

• Thats all ! You can now use it like the following example :

``` #include "main.h"
void main (){
    _printf("Hello, World\n");
    } ```
